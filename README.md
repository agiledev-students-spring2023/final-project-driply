## History

### Initial Idea

- Many people such as high school and college students often are interested in fashion. They are looking for new fashion and styles to experiment with but often find the most popular options seen on influencers and social networks are out of my price ranges. As such, there is a need for a social networking app entirely dedicated to budget fashion where users can find and share their outfits/inspirations. Fashion and trends should be accessible for everyone especially students and others who might not have the budget for designer brands.

- While most social networking applications with a photo-posting function can do implement this idea to an extend, we want to build a community specialized in and dedicated to making fashion and trends as accessible as possible for everyone, especially students and others who might not have the budget for designer brands.
