### Coding Standards
- Visual Studio Code as IDE
- Make small commits and stick to the workflow below 

---
## The Git Workflow
1. Pull recent changes <br>
	`git pull origin master`

2. Create branch. Choose a branch name for what feature you’re doing <br>
	`git checkout -b <branch-name>`

    example: <br>
	`git checkout -b user-story/13/task/9/implement-user-login`

3. Update task board TASK to “In Progress” 

4. Add and commit <br>
	`git add .` <br>
	`git commit -m “<message>”`

5. Merge remote changes <br>
	`git fetch origin` <br>
	`git merge origin/master`

6. Push branch changes to YOUR BRANCH <br>
	`git push origin <branch-name>`

7. Go on github, go to your branch and go to PULL REQUESTS. Create a pull request to push your branch into the main branch

8. Update task board TASK to awaiting review 

9. AFTER someone else reviews, approves and merges your code, delete your branch <br>
	`git push origin -d <branch-name>` <br>
	THEN switch back to master <br>
	`git checkout master` <br>
	THEN delete branch locally <br>
	`git branch -D <branch-name>` <br>
    to check the branch you’re currently on <br>
	`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`

## Rules of Contributing and Any Considerations or How and What to Contribute
- Follow the git workflow above.
- Use GitHub Issues to view and assign work.
- Follow the Agile & Scrum methodology.

## Setting up the local development environment

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed on your local machine
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your local machine
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as code editor

### Installation
1. Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git.
```
git clone https://github.com/agiledev-students-spring-2023/final-project-driply.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal.
```
cd final_project_driply
```
3. Install the dependencies required for the project using npm, as seen in the steps below in "Building the Project"


---
## Building the Project

### Build and launch the front end

1. Run ```cd front-end``` to navigate into the front-end directory
2. Run ```npm install``` to install all dependencies listed in the package.json file.
3. Run ```npm start``` to launch the React.js server

### Build and launch the back end

1. Run ```cd back-end``` to navigate into the back-end directory
2. Run ```npm install``` to install all dependencies listed in the package.json file.
3. Run ```npm start``` to launch the back-end server

___
## Testing the Project
Before contributing any changes, it's essential to make sure that the project runs without any issues. The project should pass all the unit and integration tests before merging the changes into the main branch.

To run the tests, follow the steps below:
1. Navigate into the back-end directory
2. Run ```npm test``` to execute the test cases

It's crucial to ensure that all tests pass before submitting any changes. If there are any test failures, fix the issues before submitting the changes.

Additionally, you can test the project manually by running it on your local machine and verifying that all the features and functionalities work as expected.
